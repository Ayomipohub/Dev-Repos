# **WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION**

## Introduction to WEB STACK

### What is Web Stack?
> A web stack, also known as a web application stack or simply a web stack, refers to a set of software components or technologies used together to build and run web applications. A typical web stack consists of several layers, each serving a specific purpose in the development and operation of web applications.

**Types Of Web Stack**

1. LAMP Stack:

  -  Components: Linux (Operating System),Apache (Web Server), MySQL (Database), PHP/Python/Perl,
      (Server-Side  Scripting)

  -  Use Cases: Traditional and dynamic web applications.


2. MEAN Stack:

  -  Components: MongoDB (NoSQL Database), Express.js (Web Application Framework), Angular (Front-End Framework), Node.js (JavaScript Runtime for Server-Side)
 
  -  Use Cases: Real-time applications, single-page applications (SPAs).


3. MERN Stack:

  -  Components: MongoDB (NoSQL Database), Express.js (Web Application Framework), 
     React.js (Front-End Library), Node.js (JavaScript Runtime for Server-Side)

  -  Use Cases:Modern web applications, SPAs.


4. MEVN Stack:

  -  Components: MongoDB (NoSQL Database), Express.js (Web Application Framework), 
     Vue.js (Front-End Framework), Node.js (JavaScript Runtime for Server-Side)

  -  Use Cases: Modern web applications, SPAs.


  ## `LAMP STACK`

  The LAMP stack, which stands for *Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl*, is a popular open-source software stack used for web development. Each component of the stack serves a specific purpose, and together they provide a powerful environment for building and deploying dynamic web applications.

  > Here are the essential functions of each component in the LAMP stack:

  1. **Linux (Operating System)**:

    - Function: Provides the foundational operating system for the entire stack.

    - Key Features:
   
        *Stability*: Linux is known for its stability and reliability.
   
        *Security*: Linux offers robust security features, including user permissions and firewall capabilities.
  
        *Open Source*: Linux is open-source and allows for customization and optimization.


2. **Apache (Web Server)**:

    - Function: Serves as the web server to handle HTTP requests and deliver web content to clients.

    - Key Features:
   
        *HTTP Server*: Apache is a widely-used HTTP server that supports the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
   
        *Virtual Hosting*: Allows hosting multiple websites on a single server.
   
        *Modules*: Apache supports modules for extending functionality, such as mod_rewrite for URL rewriting.


3. **MySQL (Database Management System)**:

    - Function: Manages and stores data in a relational database.

    - Key Features:
   
        *Relational Database*: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS).
   
        *SQL Support*: Supports the Structured Query Language (SQL) for database operations.
   
        *ACID Compliance*: Ensures data integrity through Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.


4. **PHP/Python/Perl (Scripting/Programming Language)**:

    - Function: Handles server-side scripting for dynamic content generation.

    - Key Features:
   
        *Server-Side Scripting*: Enables the execution of scripts on the server to generate dynamic web content.
   
        *Integration*: PHP, Python, or Perl are integrated with HTML to create dynamic web pages.
   
        *Extensibility*: Supports the use of additional libraries and frameworks for web development.
