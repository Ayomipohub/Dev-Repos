# `cd` command


## cd command, which stands for "change directory," is used in Linux, to change the current working directory. It allows you to navigate through the file system by moving from one directory to another.


### If you run cd without any arguments, it will take you to your home directory. If you provide a directory name as an argument, it will change your current working directory to that specified directory.
