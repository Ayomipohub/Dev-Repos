# `Shell Scripting`

## Introduction to shell scripting

### What is shell scripting?
> Shell scripting is a form of programming or scripting that involves writing a series of commands for a command-line interpreter, or shell, to execute. A shell is a user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. Shell scripts are essentially text files containing a sequence of such commands that can be executed together as a single program.

**Key Aspects of Shell Scripting**

1.  *Interactivity*: Shells provide an interactive environment where users can enter commands and receive immediate feedback. Shell scripts allow users to automate sequences of these commands.

2. *Scripting Language*: Shell scripts are typically written in scripting languages specific to the shell environment. For example, Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular scripting language for Unix-like operating systems, while PowerShell is commonly used in Windows environments.

3. *Automation*: The primary purpose of shell scripting is automation. Users can create scripts to perform repetitive tasks, execute multiple commands in sequence, or automate system administration tasks.

4. *Control Structures*: Shell scripts support control structures such as loops, conditionals, and functions, allowing for more complex and dynamic behavior. This enables scriptwriters to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.

5. *Variables and Environment*: Shell scripts can use variables to store and manipulate data, making it possible to create dynamic and adaptable scripts. They also interact with the environment, using environment variables for configuration and communication with other processes.

6. *File Handling*: Shell scripts can manipulate files and directories, perform file operations, and handle input/output operations. This is crucial for tasks like data processing, file manipulation, and system configuration.
