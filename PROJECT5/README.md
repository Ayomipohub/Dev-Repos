# `Shell Scripting`

## Introduction to shell scripting

### What is shell scripting?
> Shell scripting is a form of programming or scripting that involves writing a series of commands for a command-line interpreter, or shell, to execute. A shell is a user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. Shell scripts are essentially text files containing a sequence of such commands that can be executed together as a single program.

**Key Aspects of Shell Scripting**

1.  *Interactivity*: Shells provide an interactive environment where users can enter commands and receive immediate feedback. Shell scripts allow users to automate sequences of these commands.

2. *Scripting Language*: Shell scripts are typically written in scripting languages specific to the shell environment. For example, Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a popular scripting language for Unix-like operating systems, while PowerShell is commonly used in Windows environments.

3. *Automation*: The primary purpose of shell scripting is automation. Users can create scripts to perform repetitive tasks, execute multiple commands in sequence, or automate system administration tasks.

4. *Control Structures*: Shell scripts support control structures such as loops, conditionals, and functions, allowing for more complex and dynamic behavior. This enables scriptwriters to make decisions and repeat actions based on certain conditions.

5. *Variables and Environment*: Shell scripts can use variables to store and manipulate data, making it possible to create dynamic and adaptable scripts. They also interact with the environment, using environment variables for configuration and communication with other processes.

**Commonly Use Shell for Scripting**
- Commonly used shells for scripting include Bash, sh (Bourne Shell), csh (C Shell), ksh (Korn Shell), and PowerShell (for Windows). The choice of shell depends on the specific requirements of the task, as well as the operating system environment in use.

**Target Audience**

i. DevOps Engineers: DevOps professionals need to know shell scripting to create and manage automation scripts in CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices.

ii. System administrators need to learn shell scripting in order to make their jobs easier. Shell scripting helps them automate repetitive tasks, control servers, and guarantee that the system is secure and running smoothly.

iii. QA Engineers can use shell scripting to make testing easier and faster, which means they don't have to do as much testing by hand.

iv. IT support and operations teams utilize shell scripting to fix problems, keep an eye on systems, and do regular maintenance to make sure the systems work at their best.


## **Getting Started With Shell Scripting**

### Shell Scripting syntax Element

1. Variables: are used to store and manipulate data. They are assigned values using the '=' operator, and the value is accessed using $variable_name.

2. Shebang:The shebang at the beginning of a script specifies the path to the shell that should be used to interpret the script. In this case, it indicates that the Bash shell should be used.

    #!/bin/bash

3.  Comments: Lines beginning with the '#' character are comments and are ignored by the shell. Comments are used to add explanations and annotations to the script for human readers.

    # This is a comment

4.  Command Execution:This allows you to capture the output of a command and store it in a variable. The $(command) syntax is used for command substitution.

    result=$(command)

5.  Control Flow

    a. Conditionals: Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. Square brackets are used for testing conditions.

        if [ condition ]; then
         # commands
        elif [ another_condition ]; then
            # commands
        else
            # commands
        fi

6. *File Handling*: Shell scripts can manipulate files and directories, perform file operations, and handle input/output operations. This is crucial for tasks like data processing, file manipulation, and system configuration.
