## 'sudo' command

 sudo is designed to enable a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser while providing a record of the command and its arguments for auditing purposes. It also allows system administrators to control which users are allowed to run specific commands.


When you execute this command 'sudo apt upgrade', apt will check for updates for all installed packages on your system and prompt you to confirm whether you want to proceed with the upgrade. If updates are available, it will download and install them.
